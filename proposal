Light bikes
Inspired by [Tron Legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy)

# Parts of the project

## Titlescreen

Will have a select for whether to start, 2 player mode, or 1 player + A.I.
In the background is 2 A.I. Players playing

## The battlefield
Bikes leave a trail of lights.
If a bike runs into a trail it dies.
The goal is to be the last one left.
Don't run into trails.

### Player
Player control is done by using the joystick

### A.I.
Looks ahead a few cycles trying all possible combinations to see which is the best conditions
Each cycle both players could make 3 different moves, turn left, turn right, move straight
The best conditions would be maximizing it's space on a [Voronoi Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram)
Voronoi Diagram would be calculated using Dijkstra's or A* algorithm
If too slow with all the searching on every point, use a Monte Carlo approximation
