Light Bikes
============
Inspired by [Tron Legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy)

## Parts of the project

### Titlescreen

Will have a select for whether to start, 2 player mode, or 1 player + A.I.
In the background is 2 A.I. Players playing

### The Battlefield
Bikes leave a trail of lights.
If a bike runs into a trail it dies.
The goal is to be the last one left.
Don't run into trails.
Constant time between frame ticks

#### Player
Player control is done by using the joystick

#### A.I. ideas
##### Simple
Goes straight has a 10 percent chance to randomly turn left or right.
If would drive into a tile that it can avoid, it will.

##### Medium complexity
Finite state machine:
states would be early game, middle game, end game, attacking, defending
each would have it's own routine where behavior is defined differently
eg)
    starts in early game, board is relatively free, once a certain amount of lines are placed, switch to middle game.
    If in an attacking position switch to attacking, if forced into a defensive position, switch to defense.
    Once the player and enemy are in separate boxes switch to endgame.
    
##### Complex
Looks ahead a few ticks trying all possible combinations of moves to see which is the best condition.
Each cycle both players could make 3 different moves, turn left, turn right, move straight.
The best conditions would be maximizing it's space on a [Voronoi Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).
Voronoi Diagram would be calculated using Dijkstra's or A* algorithm.
If too slow with all the searching on every point, use a Monte Carlo approximation.

## Milestone goals
- [ ] Have a working two player light bike game
- [ ] Create a basic title screen
- [ ] Create a basic A.I. player for 1 player mode
- [ ] Create a title screen with A.I. players competing
- [ ] Create a more advanced A.I.
- [ ] Adjustable difficulties for the A.I.
