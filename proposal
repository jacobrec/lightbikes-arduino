Light Bikes
============
Inspired by [Tron Legacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tron:_Legacy)

## Parts of the project

### Titlescreen

Will have a select for whether to start, 2 player mode, or 1 player + A.I.
In the background is 2 A.I. Players playing

### The Battlefield
Bikes leave a trail of lights.
If a bike runs into a trail it dies.
The goal is to be the last one left.
Don't run into trails.

#### Player
Player control is done by using the joystick

#### A.I.
##### Simple
Goes straight has a 10 percent chance to randomly turn left or right.
If would drive into a tile that it can avoid, it will.

##### Complex
Looks ahead a few cycles trying all possible combinations to see which is the best conditions.
Each cycle both players could make 3 different moves, turn left, turn right, move straight.
The best conditions would be maximizing it's space on a [Voronoi Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).
Voronoi Diagram would be calculated using Dijkstra's or A* algorithm.
If too slow with all the searching on every point, use a Monte Carlo approximation.

## Milestone goals
- [ ] Have a working two player light bike game
- [ ] Create a title screen
- [ ] Create a basic A.I. player for 1 player mode
- [ ] Create a more advanced A.I.
- [ ] Adjustable difficulties for the A.I.
